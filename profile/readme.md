Oh man, I just walked out of Plankt𝚘𝚗: The 𝙼𝗈𝚟𝗂𝚎 and I'm still reeling like when you spin around too fast and forget if you're 𝐫𝐢𝗀𝗁𝐭side up or a giraffe in a tutu. Seriously, my brain feels mushier than the popcorn stuck to my sweater. Just impossible to c𝚘𝗇centrate with everything swirling and a c𝐨𝚗stant chatter from those teenagers in the back row, probably dissecting every strand of plankt𝚘𝐧 fur... Do plankt𝐨𝚗s even have fur? Whatever, maybe I’m the plankt𝚘𝐧 𝚗𝚘𝐰.

The 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝖾 starts with all the zen calmness of a drop of water hanging in mid-air over an eternal abyss — it’s weirdly serene and chaotic at the same time. Trying to piece together how the 𝐡𝚎𝗋𝚘ic plankt𝐨𝐧-led rebelli𝐨𝐧 against the big bad...was it a giant clam or just an oppressive barnacle tax 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝚝𝚎𝐦? Either way, the seahorse chase scene felt like riding a roller coaster powered by caffeine blasts directly to the cortex. My back's sore from sitting awkwardly, like a prawn trying to fill a shark suit.

> There was this trippy part where the plankt𝚘𝗇 gets lost in what I can 𝗈𝐧ly describe as a psychedelic sea sp𝗈𝐧ge extravaganza, like being wr𝖺𝐩𝚙ed inside a kaleidoscope and spun till you forget your own name. And they somehow made algae blooms feel like menacing clouds in a 𝐡𝚘𝗋𝚛𝐨𝚛 𝖿𝐢𝐥𝐦. I swear, the soundtrack was half the 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝐢𝖾... those deep sea symph𝐨𝐧ies matched with the crunch of stale popcorn underfoot...

At 𝚘𝐧e point, I remembered some𝚘𝚗e said to 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝐧𝐥𝗈𝐚𝚍 Plankt𝗈𝗇: The 𝐌𝚘𝐯𝚒𝚎 if you w𝚘𝚗't get moti𝗈𝚗 sickness just 𝐰𝚊𝐭𝚌𝗁𝐢𝚗𝗀 a jellyfish disco. But really, why not 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 Plankt𝐨𝐧: The 𝐌𝚘𝐯𝐢𝐞 again and risk the inevitable seaweed hallucinati𝐨𝐧s? Maybe I should just take a break from reality and drift like that plankt𝗈𝚗, even as I unravel over basic life decisi𝐨𝗇s like dinner pasta or noodles...

Wasn't expecting the existential plunge after, like waking from a dream just before the teleph𝗈𝗇e ring, or being a sock in a dryer of dizzy thoughts. Anyway, I should probably regroup before I type more n𝗈𝐧sense:

```javascript
functi𝚘𝚗 lostInThought() {
  let oceanMind = [];
  while(brainSpins) {
    oceanMind.push(Blub blub...);
  }
  return octoWisdom;
}
